    "selftext": "The first class was easy, one paper that ended up being 5 pages, and I finished the class in a day. The second was real tough though- statistics. I spent 3-4 hours a day studying (about 1 hour was at work during free time) and was able to score exemplary overall! I’m NOT a math person so I’m super proud of this. For anyone taking Statistics in Healthcare really pay attention to the preassessment- some questions in the test were word for word!!",
