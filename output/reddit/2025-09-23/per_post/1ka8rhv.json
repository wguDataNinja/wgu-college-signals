  "conversation_summary": "A prospective student, having completed prerequisites, posted asking two specific operational questions: whether clinical placement for the RN-to-BSN still takes over a year and which CORE courses require Objective Assessments (OAs). The post received no comments, so there is no peer-sourced answer or clarification in this thread. The absence of replies signals an information gap for prospective students seeking quick community guidance. For leadership, the thread highlights demand for clear, accessible information about clinical placement timelines and the OA requirement map. Improving published timelines and an explicit OA-by-course list (or searchable FAQ) would address the poster's primary decision drivers and reduce reliance on community forums. Monitoring for similar unanswered posts could identify recurring transparency issues affecting enrollment decisions."
