  "conversation_summary": "The OP (RN-to-BSN) plans 12 classes over 6 months and expects many papers; they are new to WGU. Responders generally say the pace is achievable, with one reporting ~3.5 days per class and another noting they finished a class well before the deadline. However, those commenters identify as being in different majors, so applicability to RN-BSN is uncertain. Affordability is noted as a motivating factor by the OP. The thread is small and anecdotal, offering encouraging but limited evidence that an accelerated schedule can work. Leadership should view these signals as positive on speed and cost, but interpret applicability to RN-BSN cautiously and seek RN-BSN–specific feedback or data before changing program messaging."
