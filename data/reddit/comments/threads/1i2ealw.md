# RN to BSN?

How is the RN to BSN program? Can I do this while doing a new grad residency ? Can I accelerate finishing the BSN in one term ? I’m in CA.

## Comments
- I completed the program in 2020 in 6 months while working full time. There are new clinical requirements that were not present when I completed the program, so I can’t comment on the difficulty. The rest of it was not difficult, however I had worked as an RN for 13 years at the time.
