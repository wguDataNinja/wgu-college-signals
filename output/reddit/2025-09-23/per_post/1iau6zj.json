    "selftext": "I'm at the end of the RN-BSN program which involves putting together an extensive professional portfolio and obtaining off-site certifications. I had been working on both of these for a couple months, probably clocking about 5-10 hours per week. Few days ago I get an email saying they will be withdrawing me from the program due to academic inactivity with an option to appeal. So of course I immediately respond, frustrated, mostly confused. Get a call from WGU staff who said I hadn't done anything that could be considered \"academic activity\" and my professor was concerned so she reported me to the department that carries out these inactivity withdrawals. No explanation as to what counts as \"academic activity\" could be provided. The projects I'm working on don't involve any course content and are entirely off the WGU site. Throughout the course, my instructor had changed 3 times and I only ever got copy/pasted emails from them about holiday availability. I regularly check my school email, but decided to check it very thoroughly to see if I missed something, but nope. Everything was fine after I explained this, but had I not responded immediately, I would have had to appeal in time. Not too sure what that would entail, but sounded like a pain. Anyway, check your email daily I guess haha.",

  "conversation_summary": "The thread centers on a student facing inactivity withdrawal near program completion and peers offering pragmatic fixes and warnings. Several commenters stress simple mitigations: keep mentors/CI informed (weekly status emails) and perform minimal LMS actions (clicking around) to register activity. Others note proactive instructor follow-up (e.g., on retake exams), showing some oversight but also creating student friction. A separate recurring concern is difficulty securing clinical sites/preceptors—one commenter reported six months of rejections and suspicion that delays can increase time/term costs. Overall the tone mixes practical, tactical advice to avoid administrative penalties with frustration about placement logistics and opaque monitoring. Implications for leadership: clarify activity rules and communication expectations, streamline clinical placement supports, and address perceptions that process issues can drive extra terms or costs."
