1n7051o,37,Is there a such thing as completing too fast?,"I began the RN-BSN program yesterday and have completed the requirements for 3 courses already, but I am scared to submit them because it's only been two days. I started 09/01/25 at 10:15 am EST after I got off the phone with my mentor, and worked on 3 courses till 11:15 pm, and then submitted 2 of the courses' PAs. One has already been graded as a pass. Today I continued working on that 3rd course at 9:30 am, and it is now 8:00 pm, and I have completed the PAs for the course, but I am afraid to submit it. For context, I just finished my Associate's Degree in Nursing in May, and these 3 courses were things we already learned, so I knew the material. I don't want my speed to be presumed as cheating or a red flag, but I also don't want to waste time slow walking things I already know. I Also have a lot of time to work on coursework during the week because I only work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and have no other obligations. I want to complete the program in one semester, so I would rather spend the majority of my time on subjects I know I will struggle with, like Statistics lol I'll need the whole 6 months for that.",2025-09-03T00:14:54Z,WGU,/r/WGU/comments/1n7051o/is_there_a_such_thing_as_completing_too_fast/
1ggolwa,22,Thinking of RN-BSN,"Hello, This is my first time posting on this subreddit since I'm a lurker on here lol. I am in a BSN program at my school, its just really expensive and I was thinking of doing my school's ASN program instead and finishing up at WGU for my BSN. If WGU takes all my credits I would probably only need to take about 9 to 11 of these classes. https://preview.redd.it/4hsh30nqk5yd1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af82b9b3cacdf8e4775b7b65d6cd740b3c637dd I would save anywhere from $20k-$23k in loans taking this route since my current school is so expensive. Would you recommend the program? How long did each class take? What do you wish you could've done differently or that WGU could have done differently? And how long did it take you to complete the RN-BSN program? I'd love to get some information and save myself from a student debt hole. I was already thinking of doing WGU's MSN program after a few years as a staff nurse, so if anyone has any info on that, I'd love to hear it as well.",2024-10-31T20:44:54Z,WGU,/r/WGU/comments/1ggolwa/thinking_of_rnbsn/
1iyysxz,21,WGU RN to BSN program in 2025,"Hi, I am a nurse with my ADN working in CA. I am looking into the RN to BSN program at WGU. I have been reading a lot of mixed reviews. Overall, I think I am still leaning towards going here because it seems to be the most affordable/flexible option. I spoke to someone at WGU and she told me the program requires 90 clinical hours. On their website, it says 35 hours. I asked someone on their website and they also told me 35 hours. Did this change recently? Also, I read that this was a challenge for many students. Can anyone share some thoughts on their experiences with WGU? Thank you!",2025-02-26T21:27:46Z,WGU,/r/WGU/comments/1iyysxz/wgu_rn_to_bsn_program_in_2025/
1fu4ttn,21,Why I chose WGU!,"Edited 10/5/2024: The reason I chose WGU is because one 6 month term at WGU costs about $5k. While similar schools like Keiser charge around $11k (including books and fees) per 4-month semester, come to find out a lot of online colleges (like Snhu) charge about $450+ per credit hour. The national average for a 2-4yr bachelors is around $25-$35k, but at similar universities like Keiser, SHNU, Prude, etc. can run upwards of $10k-$20k above the national average. Not saying those colleges are less competent or inferior. WGU offers ""Competency-Based Education"" (equivalent to credit hours) which allows you to work at a faster pace. ""*Competency-based education means that students progress through courses as soon as they can prove they’ve mastered the material, rather than advancing only when the semester or term ends. If you can learn faster, spend more time on schoolwork, or lean on the knowledge you already have from previous work or school experience, you can accelerate through your courses.*"" This approach gives students the ability to earn a bachelor's in 6 to 12 months as a first-time student without prior experience and save money. You can earn a bachelors spending less than $10k. No one should go broke or in serious debt for trying to have a better life and contribute immensely to society. Also for the inspiring nurses WGU offer the BSN (pre-licensure) meaning you can enroll without already being a registered nurse, and earn your RN license while working towards your degree. WGU has partner labs across 24 states allowing clinicals to be more accessible and included in your tuition. Don't forget to check out the many scholarships offered and reverse transfer partners. Reverse transfer is the ability to earn your associate's with credits earned from WGU to satisfy requirements at partnered community college or universities. I'm not an expert, but this is everything I gathered while doing my own research. I'm not going to talk about everything WGU have to offer and why I chose WGU. But I wanted to highlight several reasons. I am transferring in with over 30 credits, so hopefully I will be done with my Bachelor in Health Science within several months. After spending the last several weeks looking and applying to different post-secondary education trying find a affordable and flexible online college WGU turned out to be the best for me. Don't just take my word for it, check out testimonies across Reddit, YouTube, etc. WGU is highly accredited and recognized across the nation.",2024-10-02T01:33:47Z,WGU,/r/WGU/comments/1fu4ttn/why_i_chose_wgu/

1iau6zj,7,Inactivity Withdrawal,"I'm at the end of the RN-BSN program which involves putting together an extensive professional portfolio and obtaining off-site certifications. I had been working on both of these for a couple months, probably clocking about 5-10 hours per week. Few days ago I get an email saying they will be withdrawing me from the program due to academic inactivity with an option to appeal. So of course I immediately respond, frustrated, mostly confused. Get a call from WGU staff who said I hadn't done anything that could be considered ""academic activity"" and my professor was concerned so she reported me to the department that carries out these inactivity withdrawals. No explanation as to what counts as ""academic activity"" could be provided. The projects I'm working on don't involve any course content and are entirely off the WGU site. Throughout the course, my instructor had changed 3 times and I only ever got copy/pasted emails from them about holiday availability. I regularly check my school email, but decided to check it very thoroughly to see if I missed something, but nope. Everything was fine after I explained this, but had I not responded immediately, I would have had to appeal in time. Not too sure what that would entail, but sounded like a pain. Anyway, check your email daily I guess haha.",2025-01-26T23:48:34Z,WGU,/r/WGU/comments/1iau6zj/inactivity_withdrawal/
1ipzgri,6,Help? New student looking to accelerate.,"Hey all, thanks for your help in advance. I'm an RN looking to do the RN-BSN, preferably in 6 months as I'm looking to apply to medical school by end of year. I am very driven and believe I'm capable of doing it, I did a ton of accelerated class work at my state community college and always got done early. I just love learning, it's very enjoyable for me and I have no problem doing it 8 hours a day honestly. What's the best way to do this? I just enrolled and got my degree plan, am I supposed to contact the program mentor? It did say in the orientation guide that if I finish all my classes early I can get a one time move for the rest of the classes? Is this correct?

1l9mifs,4,RN Considering WGU MBA — General vs Healthcare Management?,"Hey everyone, reposting this since I didn’t really get many responses the first time: I’m a Canadian RN with a BSN and about 4 years of experience split between psych and corrections nursing. I’m currently working as a travel nurse in the U.S. and considering going back to Canada in a couple years. While I enjoy my work for now, I’ve been thinking seriously about the long game and how to open up more career options down the line — especially something that could eventually get me into the $150K+ range. I’ve narrowed it down to either WGU’s General MBA or the MBA in Healthcare Management, but I’m stuck on which one makes more sense for someone with a nursing background. Right now I’m leaning towards the Healthcare MBA. Again, I don’t hate nursing — I actually enjoy it — but I want to have a degree that gives me flexibility if I ever want to step away from bedside work or get into leadership, consulting, informatics, or health tech strategy roles. This is also the reason I don’t wanna get an MSN. Questions for any nurses here who’ve done either MBA at WGU: - Which one did you choose and why? - What kind of roles did you end up in (if you pivoted)? - Was it respected or helpful in getting you interviews? - Did it actually change your earning potential? If anyone has experience specifically in mental health, public health, consulting, or even just moving into admin from bedside after the degree, I’d love to hear how it played out. Thanks in advance — and congrats to anyone who’s already finished their degree! 👏",2025-06-12T13:29:38Z,WGU,/r/WGU/comments/1l9mifs/rn_considering_wgu_mba_general_vs_healthcare/

My hesitation is that one day after I graduate from my BSN from WGU, while I have seen many NP, DNP, and FNP's get accepted into their programs after going to WGU for their BSN--- is that I am worried some universities will not accept me later on with these 6 classes done at study/sophia/straighterline.com.

I have seen one person so far that got their RN-BSN from WGU and got accepted at UNC for their DNP program, but I do not know if they took any credits from any of the above websites.
