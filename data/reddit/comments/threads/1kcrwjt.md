# WGU

Hi, I am RN. I will be starting my RN to BSN program at WGU. I am wondering if anyone has completed this within a year. I am currently not working as I am retired.

        - Do not reach out to this person that is claiming to be able to do your papers for you. This is 100% behavior that would get you expelled.

    - If you buy papers off this clown, that is cheating. If you are caught cheating or even caught attempting to cheat you will be expelled. If they catch you later they can still revoke your degree. If you pay this clown to write your papers he will then have something to blackmail you with for more money.
