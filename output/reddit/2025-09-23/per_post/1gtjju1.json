I’m trying to think long term and I would like to keep options open to work in hospital administration and even hopefully become a Director of Nursing (or similar) later in my career. I’m also interested in health and nursing policy. Right now, I’m considering WGU for my masters, but can’t choose between the MBA in Healthcare Management and the MHA. I do intend to go back for my DNP, but that’s later in life. I want to start my Masters online soon after graduating with my BSN and passing my NCLEX. Just need to pick a degree program. I’ve even briefly contemplated doing both back to back, but I feel like that shouldn’t be necessary, lol.",

  "conversation_summary": "A WGU RN-BSN student is asking whether to pursue an MHA or an MBA with healthcare management to keep administrative career options open. A single respondent recommends the MHA for those with clinical backgrounds and cautions that obtaining both degrees is unnecessary. The commenter stresses that practical experience is more important than holding multiple graduate credentials. The thread is very short (one question, one reply), so conclusions are anecdotal but indicate a preference for clinically aligned administrative degrees. For leadership, the signal is that prospective RN-BSN students seek clear guidance on which WGU graduate path best supports hospital administration careers and value messaging that emphasizes degree alignment and the importance of experience."
