    "selftext": "Hi, I am from Michigan and I’m very interested in the BSN pre-licensure entry program, WGU is offered in Michigan but I’m not sure if I can take my NCLEX and get a Michigan RN license upon graduation. If I go to WGU and get a BSN in Nursing, will I be able to sit for the NCLEX in Michigan? Will I be able to get a Michigan RN license with a BSN from WGU (western governors university)",
