A single commenter advises there are pros and cons: a general MBA is less specialized and may broaden opportunities outside healthcare, while a specialized healthcare MBA could be more directly relevant for senior healthcare leadership roles. The thread contains very limited engagement (one comment) and both the post and reply are truncated, providing incomplete detail. As a result, there is no explicit discussion of WGU-specific strengths, weaknesses, costs, or outcomes. For leadership, the thread signals candidate interest in degree specialization trade-offs but offers no reputational data about WGU; follow-up conversations should solicit program-specific concerns (time to completion, clinical credit transfer, career outcomes) to better inform RN-BSN/RN-to-MBA positioning."

    "selftext": "Edited 10/5/2024: The reason I chose WGU is because one 6 month term at WGU costs about $5k. While similar schools like Keiser charge around $11k (including books and fees) per 4-month semester, come to find out a lot of online colleges (like Snhu) charge about $450+ per credit hour. The national average for a 2-4yr bachelors is around $25-$35k, but at similar universities like Keiser, SHNU, Prude, etc. can run upwards of $10k-$20k above the national average. Not saying those colleges are less competent or inferior. WGU offers \"Competency-Based Education\" (equivalent to credit hours) which allows you to work at a faster pace. \"*Competency-based education means that students progress through courses as soon as they can prove they’ve mastered the material, rather than advancing only when the semester or term ends. If you can learn faster, spend more time on schoolwork, or lean on the knowledge you already have from previous work or school experience, you can accelerate through your courses.*\" This approach gives students the ability to earn a bachelor's in 6 to 12 months as a first-time student without prior experience and save money. You can earn a bachelors spending less than $10k. No one should go broke or in serious debt for trying to have a better life and contribute immensely to society. Also for the inspiring nurses WGU offer the BSN (pre-licensure) meaning you can enroll without already being a registered nurse, and earn your RN license while working towards your degree. WGU has partner labs across 24 states allowing clinicals to be more accessible and included in your tuition. Don't forget to check out the many scholarships offered and reverse transfer partners. Reverse transfer is the ability to earn your associate's with credits earned from WGU to satisfy requirements at partnered community college or universities. I'm not an expert, but this is everything I gathered while doing my own research. I'm not going to talk about everything WGU have to offer and why I chose WGU. But I wanted to highlight several reasons. I am transferring in with over 30 credits, so hopefully I will be done with my Bachelor in Health Science within several months. After spending the last several weeks looking and applying to different post-secondary education trying find a affordable and flexible online college WGU turned out to be the best for me. Don't just take my word for it, check out testimonies across Reddit, YouTube, etc. WGU is highly accredited and recognized across the nation.",

There is no substantive discussion about WGU-specific decision drivers such as cost, clinical placement, pacing, faculty support, or program reputation. The tone is informational and planning-oriented from the poster, with no reported outcomes or evaluations. For leadership, this thread signals prospective-student planning behavior but provides no direct evidence about why applicants choose WGU or experience with the program; follow-up engagement could capture decision drivers and convert interest into enrollment."

If WGU takes all my credits I would probably only need to take about 9 to 11 of these classes. https://preview.redd.it/4hsh30nqk5yd1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af82b9b3cacdf8e4775b7b65d6cd740b3c637dd I would save anywhere from $20k-$23k in loans taking this route since my current school is so expensive. Would you recommend the program? How long did each class take? What do you wish you could've done differently or that WGU could have done differently? And how long did it take you to complete the RN-BSN program? I'd love to get some information and save myself from a student debt hole. I was already thinking of doing WGU's MSN program after a few years as a staff nurse, so if anyone has any info on that, I'd love to hear it as well.",

The thread is minimal and contains truncated/incomplete text, so it fails to provide clear community confirmation about state licensure acceptance. For leadership, this indicates prospective students find WGU's state-specific pages helpful but may still need clearer, explicit guidance about NCLEX eligibility and Michigan Board of Nursing acceptance. There's an opportunity to reduce friction by ensuring the program page and outreach explicitly state licensure pathways and any state-specific requirements. Overall, WGU is perceived as available in Michigan, but the thread shows community responses may default to linking institutional resources rather than giving definitive licensure assurances."

There are no peer responses or discussion, indicating low engagement on this topic in the subreddit at the time of posting. The post signals a clear desire for peer connection and program-specific information that is currently unmet in this thread. For leadership, this represents a small but visible opportunity to proactively engage — for example, by responding with program details, linking FAQs, or encouraging community discussion. The lack of replies could reflect timing, low subreddit activity, or fragmentation of where nursing students seek information. Taking simple outreach actions could improve perceived accessibility and support for prospective or new students. Tracking similar threads could identify whether this is a recurring gap in community support."

The commenter also noted that new clinical requirements have since been added, so they could not speak to current difficulty. The thread is a single anecdote and doesn't directly answer the residency-overlap question; it offers low-confidence positive signals but highlights policy changes. For leadership, the takeaway is that WGU is perceived as flexible and capable of accelerated completion by alumni, but up-to-date clinical-hour policy and residency compatibility should be verified and communicated. Given the limited data, consider gathering more recent student experiences or clarifying clinical requirement changes publicly to address prospective-student concerns."

Few days ago I get an email saying they will be withdrawing me from the program due to academic inactivity with an option to appeal. So of course I immediately respond, frustrated, mostly confused. Get a call from WGU staff who said I hadn't done anything that could be considered \"academic activity\" and my professor was concerned so she reported me to the department that carries out these inactivity withdrawals. No explanation as to what counts as \"academic activity\" could be provided. The projects I'm working on don't involve any course content and are entirely off the WGU site. Throughout the course, my instructor had changed 3 times and I only ever got copy/pasted emails from them about holiday availability. I regularly check my school email, but decided to check it very thoroughly to see if I missed something, but nope. Everything was fine after I explained this, but had I not responded immediately, I would have had to appeal in time. Not too sure what that would entail, but sounded like a pain.

There is conflicting anecdotal information about the relative power of Tier 1 vs mentors and clear variability in mentor helpfulness and leniency. Overall the thread portrays WGU as flexible and capable of supporting fast completion, but dependent on staff/mentor practices and individual cases.

  "conversation_summary": "The thread is dominated by incoming students preparing for an October 1 RN-BSN start at WGU; many are coordinating paperwork, orientation, and are seeking cohort-specific support channels (Reddit/Discord). Several commenters clarified clinical requirements: a standard 35-hour field experience, with a 90-hour pathway for California public health nurse certification, and offered potential placement sites. An employer-commenter reported a positive hiring impression of a WGU BSN/MSN graduate, which surfaced as a practical endorsement. Multiple students reported early assignment of academic advisors, reinforcing quick onboarding. Overall the conversation focuses on logistics, peer support, and certification details rather than academic quality debates; the OP’s initial note about mixed reviews remains but the thread provided clear operational information that could reduce applicant uncertainty."

The absence of replies signals an information gap for prospective students seeking quick community guidance. For leadership, the thread highlights demand for clear, accessible information about clinical placement timelines and the OA requirement map. Improving published timelines and an explicit OA-by-course list (or searchable FAQ) would address the poster's primary decision drivers and reduce reliance on community forums. Monitoring for similar unanswered posts could identify recurring transparency issues affecting enrollment decisions."

A respondent clearly states that the Prelicensure Program is the BSN, implying eligibility for NCLEX after program completion. Another commenter clarifies that new students begin in a 'pre-nursing' portion before progressing to the Prelicensure phase, indicating a staged program structure. The thread is very short (two comments) and lacks discussion of outcomes, timelines, or costs. Main takeaways for leadership: messaging about the distinction between pre-nursing coursework and the Prelicensure BSN should be clarified to reduce applicant confusion, and the program's NCLEX-eligibility after completion is being communicated effectively in at least some community responses."

The thread contains only two comments: one unfinished/top-level reply and one follow-up stating a preference for flexibility to leave healthcare, which motivates considering the General MBA. There is little detailed discussion of program outcomes, course differences, or employer perceptions. Because engagement is minimal and a key comment is incomplete, the sample provides limited evidence but signals that prospective students value cross-sector mobility. Leadership should note interest in program choice and flexibility, and consider clearer messaging on career pathways, transferability for international RNs, and differentiated outcomes between MBA tracks. Low participation suggests opportunity for WGU to proactively provide targeted guidance to nursing audiences. "

There is clear community policing of integrity and low engagement on this thread.

Recommended attention areas are monitoring external posts for abuse, clarifying integrity policies to prospective students, and engaging accelerator communities to reinforce legitimate support channels."

  "conversation_summary": "Thread participants overwhelmingly reassure the OP that completing courses quickly at WGU is normal and supported by the competency-based model. Many share personal anecdotes of finishing multiple courses or entire RN-BSN programs in months, and repeatedly advise submitting work rather than holding back. Commenters note WGU is designed for working professionals and for learners who can accelerate when they already know material. Several users caution that core or new material can be more difficult and will naturally slow some students down. There is also some side discussion and minor confusion distinguishing pre-assessments, performance assessments, and objective assessments. Overall tone is encouraging, pragmatic, and oriented toward taking advantage of the program's flexibility while preparing for harder courses ahead."
