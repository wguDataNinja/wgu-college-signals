    "selftext": "Hi. new here. Am wondering if there are any texts out there comparable to the books they use for Pathophysiology and Statistics that I can pick up early and get a handle on these classes before I start the 6 month term. Not asking for the pdf just something comparable I can pick up say at Amazon. Also any tips on the program as I am an ADN returning to school after MANY years. Thanks in advance.",
