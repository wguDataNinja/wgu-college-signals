    "selftext": "I began the RN-BSN program yesterday and have completed the requirements for 3 courses already, but I am scared to submit them because it's only been two days. I started 09/01/25 at 10:15 am EST after I got off the phone with my mentor, and worked on 3 courses till 11:15 pm, and then submitted 2 of the courses' PAs. One has already been graded as a pass. Today I continued working on that 3rd course at 9:30 am, and it is now 8:00 pm, and I have completed the PAs for the course, but I am afraid to submit it. For context, I just finished my Associate's Degree in Nursing in May, and these 3 courses were things we already learned, so I knew the material. I don't want my speed to be presumed as cheating or a red flag, but I also don't want to waste time slow walking things I already know. I Also have a lot of time to work on coursework during the week because I only work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and have no other obligations. I want to complete the program in one semester, so I would rather spend the majority of my time on subjects I know I will struggle with, like Statistics lol I'll need the whole 6 months for that.",

  "conversation_summary": "Thread participants overwhelmingly reassure the OP that completing courses quickly at WGU is normal and supported by the competency-based model. Many share personal anecdotes of finishing multiple courses or entire RN-BSN programs in months, and repeatedly advise submitting work rather than holding back. Commenters note WGU is designed for working professionals and for learners who can accelerate when they already know material. Several users caution that core or new material can be more difficult and will naturally slow some students down. There is also some side discussion and minor confusion distinguishing pre-assessments, performance assessments, and objective assessments. Overall tone is encouraging, pragmatic, and oriented toward taking advantage of the program's flexibility while preparing for harder courses ahead."
