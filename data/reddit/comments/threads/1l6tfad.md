# Nursing Prelicensure program

This might be a silly question, but after you complete the nursing Prelicensure program are you able to take the NCLEX and become an RN? Or do you have to complete the entire BSN program in order to become a registered nurse?

- The Prelicensure Program IS a BSN.

- I think you are confusing the pre-nursing portion of the program with the entire Prelicensure program

When you start you will be in the pre-nursing portion of the program. Once you complete all the pre-nursing course you will move to the nursing portion. They are essentially separate "programs" because of how nursing accreditation works, but they are not separate degrees.

When you graduate you will have a BSN, there is no other option, and (assuming you pass the NCLEX ) you will then become an RN.
