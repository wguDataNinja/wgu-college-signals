I am mainly after how many proctored exams there are out of the 11 CORE courses and how many papers their are in each course. Do any courses have both a paper and one proctored exam in order to pass? How long does each paper need to be? I am guessing its all APA writing like the ADN program? I would appreciate any feedback from those who have taken the RN to BSN program at WGU!",

  "conversation_summary": "A California-based Reddit user posted brief interest in WGU's RN-to-BSN program and asked specifically about required clinical hours and how many proctored exams exist among the program's 11 CORE courses. The post is short and appears truncated, leaving the exact scope of the question ambiguous. There are no comments or community responses on the thread, indicating an unanswered prospect inquiry. The thread highlights that prospective students are focused on state-specific clinical placement logistics and exam/proctoring burden when evaluating WGU. Leadership could view this as an opportunity to provide clear, public-facing answers about clinical hour policies for California students and the number/format of proctored assessments to reduce friction for applicants."
