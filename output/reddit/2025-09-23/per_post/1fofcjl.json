I'm assuming I'll always work at some kind of healthcare system, but would like to be considered for some leadership or other non-clinical role. I'm wondering if just an MBA would be sufficient. Any insight? Pros/cons of both?",

  "conversation_summary": "The original poster is a BSN-prepared RN looking to transition out of bedside care and is deciding between a general MBA and a healthcare-focused MBA. A single commenter advises there are pros and cons: a general MBA is less specialized and may broaden opportunities outside healthcare, while a specialized healthcare MBA could be more directly relevant for senior healthcare leadership roles. The thread contains very limited engagement (one comment) and both the post and reply are truncated, providing incomplete detail. As a result, there is no explicit discussion of WGU-specific strengths, weaknesses, costs, or outcomes. For leadership, the thread signals candidate interest in degree specialization trade-offs but offers no reputational data about WGU; follow-up conversations should solicit program-specific concerns (time to completion, clinical credit transfer, career outcomes) to better inform RN-BSN/RN-to-MBA positioning."
