I recently spoke with a candidate (turned new hire) who completed both her BSN & MSN thigh WGU. I asked her about her experience, and she had nothing but great things to say. She said it was no joke and she worked her ass off, but there was never a time where she didn't feel supported by instructors and resources. \n\nSorry, I know that's not really what you're looking, but I hope it provides some kind of insight.

Also, if you’re in CA and would like to get your public health certificate then it’s 90 hrs. This should be done in an outpatient setting. There is a process to get the sites approved but I have not gone through this part yet. They recommend you start this process early on once you start the program so there won’t be any delays once you’re ready. It can’t be done in your department either. I plan to ask if I can do it at the employee health center outside of my department or possibly go to an elementary school and see if I can do school nursing.", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1iyysxz/wgu_rn_to_bsn_program_in_2025/mhu00o5/"}
