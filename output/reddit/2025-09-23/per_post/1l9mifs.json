    "selftext": "Hey everyone, reposting this since I didn’t really get many responses the first time: I’m a Canadian RN with a BSN and about 4 years of experience split between psych and corrections nursing. I’m currently working as a travel nurse in the U.S. and considering going back to Canada in a couple years. While I enjoy my work for now, I’ve been thinking seriously about the long game and how to open up more career options down the line — especially something that could eventually get me into the $150K+ range. I’ve narrowed it down to either WGU’s General MBA or the MBA in Healthcare Management, but I’m stuck on which one makes more sense for someone with a nursing background. Right now I’m leaning towards the Healthcare MBA. Again, I don’t hate nursing — I actually enjoy it — but I want to have a degree that gives me flexibility if I ever want to step away from bedside work or get into leadership, consulting, informatics, or health tech strategy roles. This is also the reason I don’t wanna get an MSN. Questions for any nurses here who’ve done either MBA at WGU: - Which one did you choose and why? - What kind of roles did you end up in (if you pivoted)? - Was it respected or helpful in getting you interviews? - Did it actually change your earning potential? If anyone has experience specifically in mental health, public health, consulting, or even just moving into admin from bedside after the degree, I’d love to hear how it played out. Thanks in advance — and congrats to anyone who’s already finished their degree! 👏",

  "conversation_summary": "A Canadian RN with a BSN and about four years' experience asked whether to pursue WGU's general MBA or the Healthcare Management MBA. Respondents (a small, anecdotal sample) largely recommended the Healthcare MBA unless the OP intends to exit healthcare long-term, noting it aligns with clinical experience and leadership narratives. One commenter emphasized the healthcare track only changes two classes (Service Line Development and Accreditation Audit), suggesting minimal additional coursework for targeted content. A graduate reported moving into administration after completing the program, indicating positive career impact. The OP also signaled openness to leaving healthcare in the future, and another participant raised the related question of MBA versus MSN for administration. Overall the thread frames WGU's Healthcare MBA as efficient, relevant, and helpful for administrative transitions, while the general MBA remains an option for broader career flexibility."
