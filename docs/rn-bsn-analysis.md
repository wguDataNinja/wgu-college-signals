## Executive summary
**Key finding:** Reddit discussions show WGU’s RN-BSN stands out for affordability, fast completion, and flexibility, but clinical placement and licensure rules remain the biggest barriers.

**Top decision drivers cited across threads:**
- **Cost and affordability:** WGU seen as cheaper per term than peers; savings amplified if students accelerate. [1](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1fu4ttn/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1iyysxz/)
- **Flexibility and speed:** Self-paced, competency model enables rapid finishes (reports of 6–12 months) while working full time. [3](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1ggolwa/_/t1_lx3diny/?context=3) [4](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1i2ealw/_/t1_m7e95cp/?context=3) [5](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1kcrwjt/_/t1_mq53hbr/?context=3) [6](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1n7051o/_/t1_nc5om4m/?context=3)
- **Transfer and acceleration pathways:** Credit from Sophia/Study.com/StraighterLine and reverse-transfer reduce time/cost. [7](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1k2dcvl/) [8](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1n3ys0m/_/t1_nexx41u/?context=3) [9](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1fu4ttn/_/t1_lqhk6w8/?context=3)

## Deep dives per theme

### Cost

### Conclusion

This prototype shows that LLM-driven analysis can surface clear choice drivers for WGU’s RN-BSN  (Pre-Licensure) program, with every claim traceable back to source discussions.  

The method is flexible:  
- Any WGU degree program can be searched the same way.  
- Analysis can be grouped by college or focus area.  
- Other social platforms (e.g., YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, etc.) can be included, especially where APIs allow data collection.  

The workflow is a repeatable, scalable way to monitor student perceptions across programs and platforms.
