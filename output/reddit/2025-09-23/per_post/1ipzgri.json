    "selftext": "Hey all, thanks for your help in advance. I'm an RN looking to do the RN-BSN, preferably in 6 months as I'm looking to apply to medical school by end of year. I am very driven and believe I'm capable of doing it, I did a ton of accelerated class work at my state community college and always got done early. I just love learning, it's very enjoyable for me and I have no problem doing it 8 hours a day honestly. What's the best way to do this? I just enrolled and got my degree plan, am I supposed to contact the program mentor? It did say in the orientation guide that if I finish all my classes early I can get a one time move for the rest of the classes? Is this correct? Please let me know your best advice, thank you",

  "conversation_summary": "The OP wants to complete an RN-BSN quickly (about six months) to apply to medical school. Responders offer practical, experience-based advice: transfer credits can shave time off the degree, mentors have the authority to release full terms for accelerated pacing, and contacting help desk/Tier 1 has worked for some students to get the next class opened promptly. There is conflicting anecdotal information about the relative power of Tier 1 vs mentors and clear variability in mentor helpfulness and leniency. Overall the thread portrays WGU as flexible and capable of supporting fast completion, but dependent on staff/mentor practices and individual cases. Leadership takeaway: the ability to transfer credits and staff processes (mentors and help desk) are key decision drivers for prospective accelerators; improving consistency and clear communication about mentor vs Tier 1 roles would strengthen reputation."
