I’m on maternity leave until January so I will have plenty of time to work on these, but how realistic is it to get these done by then? Also, what is does the field hours look like for this part as I’m a little confused between the BSN and MSN requirements? It’s not clear in any of the guides I can get my hands on. In California and I’ve been told I can’t opt out of the public health certification portion.",
