    "selftext": "Edited 10/5/2024: The reason I chose WGU is because one 6 month term at WGU costs about $5k. While similar schools like Keiser charge around $11k (including books and fees) per 4-month semester, come to find out a lot of online colleges (like Snhu) charge about $450+ per credit hour. The national average for a 2-4yr bachelors is around $25-$35k, but at similar universities like Keiser, SHNU, Prude, etc. can run upwards of $10k-$20k above the national average. Not saying those colleges are less competent or inferior. WGU offers \"Competency-Based Education\" (equivalent to credit hours) which allows you to work at a faster pace. \"*Competency-based education means that students progress through courses as soon as they can prove they’ve mastered the material, rather than advancing only when the semester or term ends. If you can learn faster, spend more time on schoolwork, or lean on the knowledge you already have from previous work or school experience, you can accelerate through your courses.*\" This approach gives students the ability to earn a bachelor's in 6 to 12 months as a first-time student without prior experience and save money. You can earn a bachelors spending less than $10k. No one should go broke or in serious debt for trying to have a better life and contribute immensely to society. Also for the inspiring nurses WGU offer the BSN (pre-licensure) meaning you can enroll without already being a registered nurse, and earn your RN license while working towards your degree. WGU has partner labs across 24 states allowing clinicals to be more accessible and included in your tuition. Don't forget to check out the many scholarships offered and reverse transfer partners. Reverse transfer is the ability to earn your associate's with credits earned from WGU to satisfy requirements at partnered community college or universities. I'm not an expert, but this is everything I gathered while doing my own research. I'm not going to talk about everything WGU have to offer and why I chose WGU. But I wanted to highlight several reasons. I am transferring in with over 30 credits, so hopefully I will be done with my Bachelor in Health Science within several months. After spending the last several weeks looking and applying to different post-secondary education trying find a affordable and flexible online college WGU turned out to be the best for me. Don't just take my word for it, check out testimonies across Reddit, YouTube, etc. WGU is highly accredited and recognized across the nation.",

  "conversation_summary": "The thread is overwhelmingly focused on affordability as the primary reason students choose WGU, with the original poster highlighting a ~$5k 6-month term versus much higher costs at comparable schools. Multiple commenters praise WGU’s mentors, instructors, and peer support, and several note transfer-friendly policies (including reverse transfer) as a practical advantage. The competency-based, self-paced model is seen as enabling rapid course completion for motivated students. Areas of concern center on proctoring friction—Guardian browser and proctor wait/setup issues—and occasional perceptions of scripted or uneven mentor support. Users also compare WGU cost-effectiveness with SNHU, Keiser, and other institutions, generally concluding WGU is cheaper if taking multiple courses per term. There are some deleted/removed comments, but overall sentiment skews positive with caveats about exam logistics and variable student experiences."
