  "conversation_summary": "The OP asked about progressing from LPN to RN/BSN through WGU. Respondents clarified that WGU does not support a direct LPN-to-RN pathway — that transition must be completed in person. Commenters noted WGU does offer an RN-to-BSN pathway for already-licensed RNs. There is also a WGU prelicensure BSN program that can lead to RN eligibility, but it includes extensive in-person sessions and may have admission constraints (reply was truncated). The thread is very short with limited engagement, so conclusions are based on minimal anecdotal evidence. Leadership should note confusion about LPN pathways and consider clearer messaging around LPN→RN options, the RN→BSN online offering, and the in-person requirements/limits of the prelicensure BSN."
