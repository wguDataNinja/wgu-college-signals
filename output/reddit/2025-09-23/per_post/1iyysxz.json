    "selftext": "Hi, I am a nurse with my ADN working in CA. I am looking into the RN to BSN program at WGU. I have been reading a lot of mixed reviews. Overall, I think I am still leaning towards going here because it seems to be the most affordable/flexible option. I spoke to someone at WGU and she told me the program requires 90 clinical hours. On their website, it says 35 hours. I asked someone on their website and they also told me 35 hours. Did this change recently? Also, I read that this was a challenge for many students. Can anyone share some thoughts on their experiences with WGU? Thank you!",

  "conversation_summary": "The thread is dominated by incoming students preparing for an October 1 RN-BSN start at WGU; many are coordinating paperwork, orientation, and are seeking cohort-specific support channels (Reddit/Discord). Several commenters clarified clinical requirements: a standard 35-hour field experience, with a 90-hour pathway for California public health nurse certification, and offered potential placement sites. An employer-commenter reported a positive hiring impression of a WGU BSN/MSN graduate, which surfaced as a practical endorsement. Multiple students reported early assignment of academic advisors, reinforcing quick onboarding. Overall the conversation focuses on logistics, peer support, and certification details rather than academic quality debates; the OP’s initial note about mixed reviews remains but the thread provided clear operational information that could reduce applicant uncertainty."
