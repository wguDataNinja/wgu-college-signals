# Has anyone started or completed their RN/BSN from LPN. I'm thinking about enrolling but a little hesitant.

- You can’t go from LPN to RN at WGU. 

You have to do that in person. 

You can go from RN to BSN at WGU.

  - You could go in the WGU prelicensure BSN program like any non-nurse which would lead to eligibility for the RN exam, but the prelicensure BSN has extensive in-person sessions, and you might not get advanced standing for your LPN per se.
