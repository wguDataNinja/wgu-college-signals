    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m a Canadian RN with a BSN and about 4 years of experience split between psych and corrections nursing. I’m currently working as a travel nurse in the U.S. and considering going back to Canada in a couple years. While I enjoy my work for now, I’ve been thinking seriously about the long game and how to open up more career options down the line — especially something that could eventually get me into the $150K+ range. I’ve narrowed it down to either WGU’s General MBA or the MBA in Healthcare Management, but I’m stuck on which one makes more sense for someone with a nursing background. Right now I’m leaning towards the Healthcare MBA. Again, I don’t hate nursing — I actually enjoy it — but I want to have a degree that gives me flexibility if I ever want to step away from bedside work or get into leadership, consulting, informatics, or health tech strategy roles. Questions for any nurses here who’ve done either MBA at WGU: - Which one did you choose and why? - What kind of roles did you end up in (if you pivoted)? - Was it respected or helpful in getting you interviews? - Did it actually change your earning potential? If anyone has experience specifically in mental health, public health, consulting, or even just moving into admin from bedside after the degree, I’d love to hear how it played out. Thanks in advance — and congrats to anyone who’s already finished their degree! 👏",

  "conversation_summary": "A Canadian RN with a BSN and about four years of experience posted asking whether to pursue WGU's General MBA or the MBA in Healthcare Management. The thread contains only two comments: one unfinished/top-level reply and one follow-up stating a preference for flexibility to leave healthcare, which motivates considering the General MBA. There is little detailed discussion of program outcomes, course differences, or employer perceptions. Because engagement is minimal and a key comment is incomplete, the sample provides limited evidence but signals that prospective students value cross-sector mobility. Leadership should note interest in program choice and flexibility, and consider clearer messaging on career pathways, transferability for international RNs, and differentiated outcomes between MBA tracks. Low participation suggests opportunity for WGU to proactively provide targeted guidance to nursing audiences. "
