  "conversation_summary": "A Reddit user asked whether WGU's pre-licensure RN program is unavailable to Washington residents while the RN-to-BSN is available. The single reply simply confirmed the statement with \"Yes.\" There is no additional detail about licensing, admissions, or exceptions, and the original post is truncated and lacks follow-up. Overall the thread signals awareness that WGU restricts pre-licensure enrollment by state while allowing RN-to-BSN in Washington, but it provides minimal informational value for prospective students. The low engagement and brevity increase the risk of lingering confusion among readers who need concrete guidance. Leadership should note this as an example where clearer public-facing state eligibility information would reduce uncertainty."
