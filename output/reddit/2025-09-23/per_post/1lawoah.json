I spent 3-4 hours a day studying (about 1 hour was at work during free time) and was able to score exemplary overall! I’m NOT a math person so I’m super proud of this. For anyone taking Statistics in Healthcare really pay attention to the preassessment- some questions in the test were word for word!!",

  "conversation_summary": "This single-post thread describes a student's RN-to-BSN experience completing two WGU classes in 12 days: one paper-based course the student finished in a day and a second statistics course that required 3–4 hours of study per day. The thread contains no comments, so it's an isolated anecdote rather than community consensus. Key takeaways for leadership: WGU's model enables very fast progress when coursework aligns with student strengths, but course difficulty can vary substantially (quantitative courses like statistics demand more time). The post is truncated and lacks broader context about support, assessment attempts, or outcomes. Monitor for patterns around hard-to-pass courses and consider targeted resources for statistics/quantitative classes to improve student experience and completion consistency."
