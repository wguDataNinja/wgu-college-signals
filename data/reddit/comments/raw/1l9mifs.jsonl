There were only 2 classes that differed, Service Line Development and Accreditation Audit. After graduating, I moved into Administration and now manage a remote team. My salary increased from 129K to 169K (this year). I didn’t hear any concerns about the degree coming from WGU, many nursing moving into admin have WGU degrees now.", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1l9mifs/rn_considering_wgu_mba_general_vs_healthcare/mxe1av4/"}
