# New Transcripts

I got my RN-BSN at WGU in 2021. I'm now applying for my Master's. Do I need to contact the school where I got my Associate's degree to send to WGU again or can't they just look ar my file? Seems like kind of a lot of extra work that shouldn't be needed

- Best to ask an admissions counselor but I would imagine they still have your old transcript. So unless you have earned credits from another institution since 2021 you should be good.

- Your Bachelors degree is sufficient when applying for a Masters. If you're applying to come back to WGU, use the returning grad application form -- it's shorter, and they'll know to pull your WGU transcripts.
