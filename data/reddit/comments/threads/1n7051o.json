    "selftext": "I began the RN-BSN program yesterday and have completed the requirements for 3 courses already, but I am scared to submit them because it's only been two days. I started 09/01/25 at 10:15 am EST after I got off the phone with my mentor, and worked on 3 courses till 11:15 pm, and then submitted 2 of the courses' PAs. One has already been graded as a pass. Today I continued working on that 3rd course at 9:30 am, and it is now 8:00 pm, and I have completed the PAs for the course, but I am afraid to submit it. For context, I just finished my Associate's Degree in Nursing in May, and these 3 courses were things we already learned, so I knew the material. I don't want my speed to be presumed as cheating or a red flag, but I also don't want to waste time slow walking things I already know. I Also have a lot of time to work on coursework during the week because I only work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and have no other obligations. I want to complete the program in one semester, so I would rather spend the majority of my time on subjects I know I will struggle with, like Statistics lol I'll need the whole 6 months for that.",

You can take these over and over, they are the same questions every time, and they do not count for course credit. You are not required to pass these in order to get credit for the class. This is not what is being referred to by WGU students on Reddit when they say PA. Nobody cares about these.\n\nWhat WGU students refer to as a PA is the Performance Assessment. This involves writing a research paper, or writing a business plan, or project plan, or a lab depending upon the program you are in. Some courses with a PA can be completed in a day easily if you already know the material. Your pass / fail on these count and passing these are required for course credit.\n\nThe OA, or Objective Assessment, is the typical multiple choice style exam. These are proctored exams and depending on program, may be third party certification exams. These also require you to pass in order to get credit for a course.",
