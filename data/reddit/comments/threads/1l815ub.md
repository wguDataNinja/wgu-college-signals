# RN Considering WGU MBA — General vs Healthcare Management? Any Nurses Here Done It?

Hey everyone, I’m a Canadian RN with a BSN and about 4 years of experience split between psych and corrections nursing. I’m currently working as a travel nurse in the U.S. and considering going back to Canada in a couple years. While I enjoy my work for now, I’ve been thinking seriously about the long game and how to open up more career options down the line — especially something that could eventually get me into the $150K+ range. I’ve narrowed it down to either WGU’s General MBA or the MBA in Healthcare Management, but I’m stuck on which one makes more sense for someone with a nursing background. Right now I’m leaning towards the Healthcare MBA. Again, I don’t hate nursing — I actually enjoy it — but I want to have a degree that gives me flexibility if I ever want to step away from bedside work or get into leadership, consulting, informatics, or health tech strategy roles. Questions for any nurses here who’ve done either MBA at WGU: - Which one did you choose and why? - What kind of roles did you end up in (if you pivoted)? - Was it respected or helpful in getting you interviews? - Did it actually change your earning potential? If anyone has experience specifically in mental health, public health, consulting, or even just moving into admin from bedside after the degree, I’d love to hear how it played out. Thanks in advance — and congrats to anyone who’s already finished their degree! 👏

I don't think either is the right choice for someone with a nursing background.

An MSN in Nursing Leadership and Management is probably what you need.

  - I looked into that, but I wanted the option to step out of healthcare sector if I ever felt the need to
