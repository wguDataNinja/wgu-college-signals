I highly recommend it! \nThe price is definitely right. \nAnd depending on how disciplined you are, you can get through courses quickly. Pro tip: when your assignment is being graded it take a couple of days so start on the next assignment in the meantime. \n\n\nAt times I was able to finish a class in a couple of weeks but I juggle full time job amongst other things so how long a class takes depends on you and your determination to get it done sooner than later. \n\n\nDefinitely meet with your course instructor before beginning classes and definitely before taking an assessments (exams), it can be overwhelming to see the amount of information that you need to study. But they have insight and can help you navigate through the content. \n\n\nIf I was more disciplined I could've finished sooner but if that's your goal, have a plan and stick to it 😀", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1ggolwa/thinking_of_rnbsn/lwzngzj/"}

I LOVED the fact that it was self paced and I could breeze through the courses that I already had experience in. They saved me so much money in student loans by the one cost terms. The teachers are amazing and the support is like no other! My only regret is that I didn’t start with them sooner! \n\nFor my MSN, I was already comfortable with the WGU model and so I excelled in it! I completed my MSN in 4 1/2 months.

I was doing an online program at a private school for my MSN and couldn't afford it.  When I started looking for options, WGU was a no-brainer with the difference in cost!  I'm only in my first class, but can already tell I'll be much more successful here than I was at my previous school. The format of the classes is different but much more enjoyable, in my opinion!", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1ggolwa/thinking_of_rnbsn/lx01coa/"}

The classes have taken me between a couple of days and a couple of weeks, and that's with reading and watching all of the course material.\n\nI'm faster at classes with writing assignments than proctored tests, but that's just my personal learning style. I also started a new job that's slowed me down a bit since I'm adjusting to overnights. I'm also doing a lot of online training during my shifts, making finding the motivation for school after work more challenging.\n\nI'd 100% recommend going for it. I wish I had completed my first bachelor's at WGU. I would have saved so much time and money.\n\nEditing to add a link to apply: [https://infl.tv/ozSR](https://infl.tv/ozSR)", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1ggolwa/thinking_of_rnbsn/lx0ouoy/"}

You can spend more time on courses you need to and less on those you already know. WGU does not want you in school so that they can collect money; they want you there to learn and get you into the workforce when you're ready.
