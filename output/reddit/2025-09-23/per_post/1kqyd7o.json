    "selftext": "Im a nurse with a bachelors degree I have been working for almost a year now. I’ve come to the conclusion that I hate nursing, bedside it’s not for me. Tired of night shift and 12 hrs shifts. I just came across WGU and I’m really surprised about the wide range of degrees they offer. As a nurse with a bachelors degree which degree would be the most useful to get a better job? It fought to my attention the masters degree in public health…is this a smart move? I should I reconsider ? Also another question…is it possible to complete the degree in just 1 year? lol since it’s cheaper the faster that you complete it. Thank you so much!!",

  "conversation_summary": "The OP is an RN with a bachelor's who is burned out from bedside nursing and long night shifts and is asking for help. One commenter reports choosing WGU for an MHA to move into leadership, noting they aim to finish in six months. The commenter frames WGU as a viable pathway to leadership but cautions that accelerated completion is stressful. Overall the thread signals interest in WGU for career transition and speed, but also highlights workload and stress as concerns. The sample is small and anecdotal, so while the sentiment is positive about career alignment, leadership should treat it as directional feedback rather than representative data. Consider highlighting program pacing options, clear workload expectations, and supports for students transitioning from bedside roles."
