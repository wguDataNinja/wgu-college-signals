# WGU RN to BSN program in 2025

Hi, I am a nurse with my ADN working in CA. I am looking into the RN to BSN program at WGU. I have been reading a lot of mixed reviews. Overall, I think I am still leaning towards going here because it seems to be the most affordable/flexible option. I spoke to someone at WGU and she told me the program requires 90 clinical hours. On their website, it says 35 hours. I asked someone on their website and they also told me 35 hours. Did this change recently? Also, I read that this was a challenge for many students. Can anyone share some thoughts on their experiences with WGU? Thank you!

- I am not an RN but I hire them. I recently spoke with a candidate (turned new hire) who completed both her BSN & MSN thigh WGU. I asked her about her experience, and she had nothing but great things to say. She said it was no joke and she worked her ass off, but there was never a time where she didn't feel supported by instructors and resources. 

Sorry, I know that's not really what you're looking, but I hope it provides some kind of insight. Good luck!

- hello! i just posted a similar question. I’m also looking to start this year. 

i was told the 35 hours is “field experience” that consists of some sort of research project, in lieu of traditional clinical hours

were you able to find out any more information?

  - Yes, I did get some information. There is 35 hrs of clinical hours required. Also, if you’re in CA and would like to get your public health certificate then it’s 90 hrs. This should be done in an outpatient setting. There is a process to get the sites approved but I have not gone through this part yet. They recommend you start this process early on once you start the program so there won’t be any delays once you’re ready. It can’t be done in your department either. I plan to ask if I can do it at the employee health center outside of my department or possibly go to an elementary school and see if I can do school nursing.

  - I am in California. Is it necessary or worth it to get the certification ?

    - It’s worth it if you want the option to work in public health nursing. For me, I do want that option so I plan to do the 90 hrs. If you don’t plan on working in public health at all then you can opt out of it.

- I was told by enrollment that it’s 35 hrs of “field experience” unless you want/need a California public health nurse certification then it’s 90 hrs.
