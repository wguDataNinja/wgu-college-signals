# BSN, RN crying for help

Im a nurse with a bachelors degree I have been working for almost a year now. I’ve come to the conclusion that I hate nursing, bedside it’s not for me. Tired of night shift and 12 hrs shifts. I just came across WGU and I’m really surprised about the wide range of degrees they offer. As a nurse with a bachelors degree which degree would be the most useful to get a better job? It fought to my attention the masters degree in public health…is this a smart move? I should I reconsider ? Also another question…is it possible to complete the degree in just 1 year? lol since it’s cheaper the faster that you complete it. Thank you so much!!

- I’m getting my MHA w/WGU. I think it depends on what interests you. I’m in leadership and it requires I get my masters. I’m trying to complete in 6 months. It’s stressful but I’m on task to meet my goal. Good luck!
