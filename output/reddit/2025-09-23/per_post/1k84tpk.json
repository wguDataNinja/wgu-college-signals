  "conversation_summary": "A Reddit user asked whether others are pursuing or have completed the RN-BSN and specifically asked whether they would recommend it and how clinical hours are handled (where and how many). The post received zero comments, so the question was left unanswered on the subreddit. For WGU leadership this highlights a missed opportunity for alumni/current students to influence prospective applicants and address practical logistics. The unanswered query suggests prospects may lack clear, accessible information about RN-BSN clinical requirements. Recommended actions include mobilizing alumni/current students to engage on the subreddit, creating or pinning an RN-BSN clinical-hours FAQ, and monitoring for similar unanswered posts to improve perceived responsiveness and reduce uncertainty for applicants."
