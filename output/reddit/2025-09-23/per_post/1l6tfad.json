  "conversation_summary": "The OP asked whether completing WGU's nursing Prelicensure program allows you to take the NCLEX and become an RN. A respondent clearly states that the Prelicensure Program is the BSN, implying eligibility for NCLEX after program completion. Another commenter clarifies that new students begin in a 'pre-nursing' portion before progressing to the Prelicensure phase, indicating a staged program structure. The thread is very short (two comments) and lacks discussion of outcomes, timelines, or costs. Main takeaways for leadership: messaging about the distinction between pre-nursing coursework and the Prelicensure BSN should be clarified to reduce applicant confusion, and the program's NCLEX-eligibility after completion is being communicated effectively in at least some community responses."
