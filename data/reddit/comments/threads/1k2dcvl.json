    "selftext": "HI! I am finishing my pre-nursing credits to transfer to WGU's nursing program. They accept credits from [Sophia.org/Study.com](http://Sophia.org/Study.com) and [Straighterline.com](http://Straighterline.com) and I only have 6 classes left to take to transfer into their BSN program. My hesitation is that one day after I graduate from my BSN from WGU, while I have seen many NP, DNP, and FNP's get accepted into their programs after going to WGU for their BSN--- is that I am worried some universities will not accept me later on with these 6 classes done at study/sophia/straighterline.com. Has anyone taken pre-nursing courses from one of these websites, finished their BSN, and had any trouble being accepted into NP, DNP, or FNP programs? I have seen one person so far that got their RN-BSN from WGU and got accepted at UNC for their DNP program, but I do not know if they took any credits from any of the above websites. Duke's DNP program, for instance, looks into every credit received toward a BSN, and does not accept any credits from Sophia/Study.com. Thank you!",
