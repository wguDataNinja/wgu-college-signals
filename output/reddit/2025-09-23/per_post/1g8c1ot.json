I’m on maternity leave until January so I will have plenty of time to work on these, but how realistic is it to get these done by then? Also, what is does the field hours look like for this part as I’m a little confused between the BSN and MSN requirements? It’s not clear in any of the guides I can get my hands on. In California and I’ve been told I can’t opt out of the public health certification portion.",

  "conversation_summary": "The poster states they will begin the RN→MSN leadership and management track on 11/1/24, needs 38 competency units for the BSN portion, and expects to have time to work on coursework while on maternity leave. The thread received minimal engagement — a single comment asking whether they ultimately completed the MSN program. There is no substantive discussion about WGU-specific decision drivers such as cost, clinical placement, pacing, faculty support, or program reputation. The tone is informational and planning-oriented from the poster, with no reported outcomes or evaluations. For leadership, this thread signals prospective-student planning behavior but provides no direct evidence about why applicants choose WGU or experience with the program; follow-up engagement could capture decision drivers and convert interest into enrollment."
