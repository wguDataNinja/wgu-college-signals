# RN TO BSN

I am having it extremely difficult to find clinical site. WGU cannot assigned a location, and when you find on your own they are making it extremely difficult with all their requirements. I should have finished this program this October but with all the problems I am having, I at the point where I am about to quit. This is just too much. Is anyone in this program having the same issue or its just me. Appreciate the feedback

- Check the WGU RN to BSN group on Facebook. I've read of more than one person having this issue.
