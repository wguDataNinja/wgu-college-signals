Once you complete all the pre-nursing course you will move to the nursing portion. They are essentially separate \"programs\" because of how nursing accreditation works, but they are not separate degrees.\n\nWhen you graduate you will have a BSN, there is no other option, and (assuming you pass the NCLEX ) you will then become an RN.", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1l6tfad/nursing_prelicensure_program/mwsb46p/"}
