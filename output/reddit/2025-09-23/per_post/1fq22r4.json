  "conversation_summary": "A WGU graduate asked whether their associate degree transcript needs to be resent when applying for a master's after earning an RN-BSN at WGU in 2021. Commenters generally assumed WGU retains former student transcripts and that the bachelor's degree (RN-BSN) is sufficient for master's applications. One commenter recommended using the returning graduate application if reapplying to WGU because it is shorter and the university will pull internal records. Advice was pragmatic but brief and recommended confirming with an admissions counselor for certainty, especially if the student earned other credits since 2021. Overall the thread signals positive perceptions of WGU's internal record-keeping and a straightforward re-entry process, but lacks detailed procedural guidance or official references."
