WGU cannot assigned a location, and when you find on your own they are making it extremely difficult with all their requirements. I should have finished this program this October but with all the problems I am having, I at the point where I am about to quit. This is just too much. Is anyone in this program having the same issue or its just me. Appreciate the feedback",

  "conversation_summary": "The original poster is struggling to secure a clinical site for the RN-to-BSN and reports that WGU will not assign a site; when students locate sites themselves, institutional requirements make placements difficult. A commenter advised joining the WGU RN-to-BSN Facebook group as a practical workaround and noted others have reported the same problem. The thread is short but flags a recurring operational pain point around clinical placement and the administrative burden imposed on students. Students appear to turn to peer networks for solutions rather than institutional support. For leadership, this represents a reputational and student-experience risk and suggests investigating placement assignment policy, streamlining external-site requirements, and monitoring/supporting the Facebook community as an early-warning channel."
