    "selftext": "Hello, This is my first time posting on this subreddit since I'm a lurker on here lol. I am in a BSN program at my school, its just really expensive and I was thinking of doing my school's ASN program instead and finishing up at WGU for my BSN. If WGU takes all my credits I would probably only need to take about 9 to 11 of these classes. https://preview.redd.it/4hsh30nqk5yd1.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=7af82b9b3cacdf8e4775b7b65d6cd740b3c637dd I would save anywhere from $20k-$23k in loans taking this route since my current school is so expensive. Would you recommend the program? How long did each class take? What do you wish you could've done differently or that WGU could have done differently? And how long did it take you to complete the RN-BSN program? I'd love to get some information and save myself from a student debt hole. I was already thinking of doing WGU's MSN program after a few years as a staff nurse, so if anyone has any info on that, I'd love to hear it as well.",

  "conversation_summary": "The OP is weighing options because their current BSN program is expensive and is considering doing an ASN or switching to WGU's RN‑BSN pathway. Respondents overwhelmingly recommend WGU for its affordability, flexible self‑paced format, and the ability to accelerate coursework if the student is disciplined. Multiple commenters report fast completion times (examples range from a few months to over a year), but emphasize outcomes depend on individual motivation and time commitment. Several answers come from non‑nursing WGU students who praise program quality and price, and some mention straightforward RN→MSN pathways. There are no substantive negative reports in this thread; the main cautions are about the need for self‑discipline and variable individual timelines. A small side thread requests student Discord groups, indicating interest in peer communities."
