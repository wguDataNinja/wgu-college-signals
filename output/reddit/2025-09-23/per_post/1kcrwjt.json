  "conversation_summary": "The OP (an RN who is retired) asked whether the RN→BSN at WGU can be completed within a year. One commenter provided a direct anecdote that their wife finished within a year while working full time, implying accelerated completion is possible. Much of the remainder of the thread centers on a removed comment/offering to do coursework and strong community and moderator responses warning that buying papers or plagiarism will lead to expulsion and degree revocation. Moderation invoked Rule #2 (no cheating) and emphasized protecting the degree's value. The thread offers limited tactical guidance for pacing or strategy beyond the anecdote, but it highlights two decision drivers for leadership: perceived program speed/flexibility and active enforcement of academic integrity to protect reputation. Overall the tone is supportive of WGU's credibility while vigilant about dishonest shortcuts."
