# RN w/MBA

I'm an BSN RN and would like to get away from patient care. Thinking of starting an MBA, however, I'm not sure if I should do the regular MBA or the MBA for Healthcare Management. I'm assuming I'll always work at some kind of healthcare system, but would like to be considered for some leadership or other non-clinical role. I'm wondering if just an MBA would be sufficient. Any insight? Pros/cons of both?

- Just my opinion but there would be pros and cons to both. An MBA is less specific which could open up more opportunities for you in other industries, but if you are gunning for a high level position in healthcare with just an MBA, you may get beat out by someone with an MBA HM.

You likely can't go wrong either way, but that's just a scenario I could see happening off the top of my head. I'm considering doing a masters program as well, just can't decide between MBA or MS Leadership & Management.
