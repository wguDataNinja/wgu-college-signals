I am in Utah so there is where my schooling/ clinicals will be based out of. I have a few other degrees so while I am starting the Pre-licensure program, I was able to shave 1.5 years off my degree so I am only a semester away from the core nursing curriculum. Let's connect and support each other!",

  "conversation_summary": "This is an introductory/recruitment post from an incoming WGU BSN Pre-Licensure/RN-BSN student seeking peers and community; the author notes an April start and that they are located in Utah. The thread contains no comments, showing minimal engagement on the subreddit for this cohort request. The post highlights student demand for cohort connections and local clinical coordination even within WGU's online structure. The selftext appears truncated, which reduces clarity and may have contributed to the lack of responses. For leadership, the thread suggests unmet needs around official or visible new-student cohort-building and localized support channels. Overall, it signals prospective students value peer networks and flexible start options but may struggle to find them organically on public channels."
