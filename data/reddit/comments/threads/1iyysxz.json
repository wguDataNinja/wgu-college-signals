    "selftext": "Hi, I am a nurse with my ADN working in CA. I am looking into the RN to BSN program at WGU. I have been reading a lot of mixed reviews. Overall, I think I am still leaning towards going here because it seems to be the most affordable/flexible option. I spoke to someone at WGU and she told me the program requires 90 clinical hours. On their website, it says 35 hours. I asked someone on their website and they also told me 35 hours. Did this change recently? Also, I read that this was a challenge for many students. Can anyone share some thoughts on their experiences with WGU? Thank you!",

I asked her about her experience, and she had nothing but great things to say. She said it was no joke and she worked her ass off, but there was never a time where she didn't feel supported by instructors and resources. \n\nSorry, I know that's not really what you're looking, but I hope it provides some kind of insight.

This should be done in an outpatient setting. There is a process to get the sites approved but I have not gone through this part yet. They recommend you start this process early on once you start the program so there won’t be any delays once you’re ready. It can’t be done in your department either. I plan to ask if I can do it at the employee health center outside of my department or possibly go to an elementary school and see if I can do school nursing.",
