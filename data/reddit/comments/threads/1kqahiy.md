# RN to BSN Life

I am interested in the RN to BSN program at WGU. I live in California and I see they will require clinical hours of some sort. I am mainly after how many proctored exams there are out of the 11 CORE courses and how many papers their are in each course. Do any courses have both a paper and one proctored exam in order to pass? How long does each paper need to be? I am guessing its all APA writing like the ADN program? I would appreciate any feedback from those who have taken the RN to BSN program at WGU!
