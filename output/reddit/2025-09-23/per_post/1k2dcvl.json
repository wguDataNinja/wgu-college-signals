    "selftext": "HI! I am finishing my pre-nursing credits to transfer to WGU's nursing program. They accept credits from [Sophia.org/Study.com](http://Sophia.org/Study.com) and [Straighterline.com](http://Straighterline.com) and I only have 6 classes left to take to transfer into their BSN program. My hesitation is that one day after I graduate from my BSN from WGU, while I have seen many NP, DNP, and FNP's get accepted into their programs after going to WGU for their BSN--- is that I am worried some universities will not accept me later on with these 6 classes done at study/sophia/straighterline.com. Has anyone taken pre-nursing courses from one of these websites, finished their BSN, and had any trouble being accepted into NP, DNP, or FNP programs? I have seen one person so far that got their RN-BSN from WGU and got accepted at UNC for their DNP program, but I do not know if they took any credits from any of the above websites. Duke's DNP program, for instance, looks into every credit received toward a BSN, and does not accept any credits from Sophia/Study.com. Thank you!",

  "conversation_summary": "The OP asked which NP/DNP/FNP universities accept a BSN from WGU and noted WGU accepts transfer credits from providers like Sophia/Study.com and Straighterline. The only reply emphasized that a 3.0 GPA is the baseline for competitiveness in such programs, suggesting program admissions hinge on GPA more than school origin. The thread has minimal engagement and does not list specific graduate programs, accreditation details, or state/clinical considerations. For leadership, the clear positives are WGU's transfer-credit flexibility and the implication that graduates with adequate GPA remain competitive for advanced programs. The lack of concrete university acceptance examples and low discussion volume indicate an opportunity to provide curated guidance and clear alumni outcomes to strengthen perceived transferability and reputation."
