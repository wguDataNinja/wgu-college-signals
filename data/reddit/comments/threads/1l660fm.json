    "selftext": "I am enrolling in the Bachelor of Science and Post-Baccalaureate Certificate, Nursing (RN to MSN track) - I have a few courses to finish my BSN and then start my MSN in nursing education. Looking for any input regarding coursework, time spent each week, relationship with your mentor, communication, and how to maximize getting as much accomplished in the least amount of time. I have 20 years of bedside nursing experience and currently teach part-time now as a clinical instructor, so I feel I am starting with a strong base out of the gate. Again, any and all advice or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance! :)",
