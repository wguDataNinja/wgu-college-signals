  "conversation_summary": "The OP asked whether the RN-to-BSN can be done during a new grad residency and whether it can be accelerated (OP is in CA). One commenter reported completing WGU's RN-to-BSN in 6 months while working full time (graduated in 2020), indicating potential for fast completion and flexibility. The commenter also noted that new clinical requirements have since been added, so they could not speak to current difficulty. The thread is a single anecdote and doesn't directly answer the residency-overlap question; it offers low-confidence positive signals but highlights policy changes. For leadership, the takeaway is that WGU is perceived as flexible and capable of accelerated completion by alumni, but up-to-date clinical-hour policy and residency compatibility should be verified and communicated. Given the limited data, consider gathering more recent student experiences or clarifying clinical requirement changes publicly to address prospective-student concerns."
