WGU cannot assigned a location, and when you find on your own they are making it extremely difficult with all their requirements. I should have finished this program this October but with all the problems I am having, I at the point where I am about to quit. This is just too much. Is anyone in this program having the same issue or its just me. Appreciate the feedback",
